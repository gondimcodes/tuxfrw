   				   TuxFrw
 				   ------

		 The ultimate Linux firewall automation tool.

===============================================================================

TuxFrw is a complete firewall automation tool for GNU/Linux.

Currently, TuxFrw consists of script  files  created  to  ease  the  way  Linux
IPTables firewall rules are configured. With TuxFrw, an user can configure  his
own Linux / Netfilter based network firewall, simply passing  some  IP  address
numbers and other services utilization policies. Start  with  a  default  basic
firewall, then streamline it further using your skills allied  with  the  power
of TuxFrw modularity. TuxFrw is  the  ultimate  IPTables-based  firewall  tool,
taking full advantage of this great Linux firewall framework.

Although its functionallity is not so wide, our intention is to enhance  TuxFrw
in such a way that leads it into a real complete network firewall tool.
