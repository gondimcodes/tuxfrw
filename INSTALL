TuxFrw Installation
===================

To install TuxFrw, follow these steps:

1) Run (as root):

# ./install.sh

The scripts will be installed under /etc/tuxfrw.  The  installer  will  try  to
copy the script 'tuxfrw' with the  right  permissions  under  /etc/rc.d/init.d/
and then add 'tuxfrw' as a system service.

2) Configure the variables in /etc/tuxfrw/tuxfrw.conf

With the above procedures, TuxFrw is already set up  to  start  at  boot  time.
This can be undone by the 'services' application or similar.

If the script cannot find the 'chkconfig'  program  and  the  /etc/rc.d/init.d/
directory, all files will reside under /etc/tuxfrw and 'tuxfrw' under /sbin.

Read the README and "TuxFrw Manual" for more information on running TuxFrw.
