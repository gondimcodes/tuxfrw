2.58 (2004-05-21)

- TuxFrw now supports cbq.init and htb.init directly. The tf_QoS.mod module does not 
  exist anymore. Please read their documentation and tuxfrw.conf.
- New KERN_MOD variable on tuxfrw.conf to specify if your kernel accepts modules or not.

- Improvements in tf_QoS.mod module and tuxfrw.conf.

2.56 (2003-12-01)

- Checking by Chain when the program is started.
- Included new configuration of QoS in tuxfrw.conf.
- QoS prioriting services dns, http, https, smtp, pop, imap and ftp in tf_QoS.mod module.
Obs.: The QoS was implementated in this version and I would like that any improvement should be
informed by e-mail: gondim@databras.com.br for future versions.

2.55 (2003-10-31)

- tf_KERNEL.mod modified. New modules.
- tf_NAT-OUT.mod modified. New rules.
- Kernel 2.6 support added.

2.54 (2003-05-06)

- tf_KERNEL.mod modified. Variables with incorrect values.
- Snort_Inline supported. TARGET variable added in tuxfrw.conf.

2.53 (2003.02-14)

- IPSec NAT Traversal (NAT-T) supported.
- NAT variable in tuxfrw.conf has now the following possible values:
  NAT="0" - Disabled
  NAT="1" - POSTROUTING only
  NAT="2" - PREROUTING and POSTROUTING
  NAT="3" - PREROUTING only
- Modules tf_???-???, tf_TOS, tf_INPUT, tf_OUTPUT and tf_FORWARD do not have
  the function declarations inside them anymore. Now every function is 
  declared inside the module tf_BASE.mod.
- Due to the changes above, module tf_NAT.mod has been subdivided in 2 new
  modules: tf_NAT-IN.mod and tf_NAT-OUT.mod
- Starting from this version we need at least kernel 2.4.18 to work. [Gondim]

2.52 (2002-10-03)

- Changes in function save_kernel_options and restore_kernel_options.
  These functions are using sysctl program now. [Ramoni]
- Bug fix in tfconf.sh. [Isamp]
- Changes in TuxFrw structure and module names, towards better development
  and management of the tool. There isn't tf_RULES.mod anymore, and in its 
  place there are tf_INPUT.mod, tf_OUTPUT.mod and tf_FORWARD.mod. [Gondim]

2.51 (2002-10-01)

- Changes in the mangle rules because it was causing problems with many
  Internet sites, and we dunno why. Changing TOS to 8 does not appear to
  cause any trouble. [Gondim]

2.50 (2002-09-30)

- Changes in TuxFrw structure and module names, towards better development
  and management of the tool.
- 'tfconf.sh' has been created to help the configuration of 'tuxfrw.conf'.
- 'install.sh' has been created to help the installation of TuxFrw.
- More documentation, including the new 'TuxFrw Manual'.
- Improvements made in base TuxFrw rules.
- Kernel configuration options now in 'tf_KERNEL.mod'.
- Correction of bugs related to VPN.
- Update of IANA reserved IP blocks in the spoofing protection table.
- REJECT target has been exchanged by DROP, because the first one could cause
  performance loss in a high traffic network. [Gondim]

2.15 (2002-05-16)

- The command 'tuxfrw status' has been exchanged by 'tuxfrw rules', and now the
  command 'tuxfrw status' shows information about variables and interfaces.
- Optimized interface capture code in 'tuxfrw'. Now there's a function called
  get_interface() and it is used by 'tuxfrw.conf'. Helped by Ramoni. [Gondim]

2.14 (2002-05-01)

- TuxFrw is now easier!!! :) Read the modules...
- Removed tuxLOG.mod module. It is not needed anymore.
- Modules tuxVPN-DMZ.mod, tuxDMZ-VPN.mod, tuxVPN-INT.mod and tuxINT-VPN.mod
  have been created. [Gondim]

2.13

- There were two vulnerabilities found on the last versions that allowed two
  different ways to attack using spoofing; the first one using as IP source any
  of the firewall interfaces, and the other one using the broadcast adress as
  the IP source.
- 'tuxTRJ.mod' has been removed, because it left slower the firewall startup,
  process, with not so much benefit.
- TuxFrw is now installed as default in /etc/tuxfrw, and into this directory
  it has the directory 'rules' where the rules modules are. [Gondim]

2.12 

- Correction done to the tuxKNL.mod

2.11 (2002-01-07)

- Not too many important changes. Everything we did was to translate all of
  the package files from brazilian portuguese to english. [MdS]

2.10   

- Source code has not been altered, only the listing of TuxFrw contributors.

2.10p4 

- Credits for previous creators of CFTK, the sotfware which served as base 
  for TuxFrw.

2.10p3 

- REJECT rules corrected on modules tuxLOG and tuxRULES.

2.10p2 

- BUG FIX: related to TuxFrw module loading when some networks like DMZ did
  not exist.

2.10p1 

- REJECT rules of tuxLOG and tuxRULES modules have been enhanced.

2.9

- Now TuxFrw does automatic retrieving of IP, broadcast and netmask addresses,
  based on interface names only.

2.8    

- tuxLOG and tuxRULES modules have been altered to support packet REJECTion
  instead of DROPing in order to the firewall become more "stealthy". 
- Addition of tcp_ecn (Explicit Congestion Notification) paramenter to tuxKNL.
  The two contributions above have been posted by Marcelo de Souza from ACME! 
  (http://www.acme-ids.org/~marcelo).
- Andre Luiz <ramoni@linuxinfo.com.br> had contributed with a small change in
  the 'tuxfrw' file in order to the 'modprobe' and 'iptables' commands be 
  automatically detected.
- Heavy changes on files 'trojans' and 'tuxATK.mod' to load the Trojans table
  fastly. Now the 'trojans' file is merely used as a query source, giving space
  to the tuxTRJ module.

2.7    

- A function responsible for OUTPUT rules has been added to the tuxRULES
  module, because some admins use these rules to "close" the firewall even more.
  When the command 'tuxfrw stop' is calles, TuxFrw will clean all chains but
  keep NAT rules. [Gondim]

2.6 

- No changes have been done to the source code, only to the some module names
  in order to easialy recognize its function, e.g. 'tuxaux.mod' --> 'tuxLOG.mod'
  [Gondim]

2.5 

- In this version I decided to take NAT and TOS functions off tuxRULES module.
  It can ease the way these things are handled by ISPs. Now we have tuxTOS and 
  tuxNAT modules. [Gondim]

2.4

- We've received a excellent contribution from R.Carneval enhancing TuxFrw 
  performance. [Gondim]
- Now we have TROJAN_CHECK split into two new chains, TROJAN_CHECK_TCP and
  TROJAN_CHECK_UDP. Some limit matching has been added to log generation on 
  'tuxaux.mod' file. [Gondim]
- ICMP spoofing protection. [Gondim]

2.3

- Lines containing tcp-reset have been removed from tuxRULES module, cause 
  they helped port gathering done by nmap. [Gondim]

2.2 

- Changes done to variables location on 'tuxfrw.conf'. [Gondim]
- Suport to PigMeat. PigMeat is a tool that blocks atacks in real-time, based
  on Snort IDS. PigMeat can be downloaded from htp://pigmeat.linuxinfo.com.br
  [Gondim]

2.1

- Correction done to the installation process where the MODULES variable 
  pointed to "./", and now points to the value of the variable INSTALLPATH. Due
  to this error the firewall didn't load up correctly after boot. 
- Enhancements related to the use of the IP_VPN variable. [Gondim]
 

2.0

- Too many changes, cause now TuxFrw is modular. There is a file module to 
  each specific set of rules.
- Instalation and Uninstallation through proper commands.
- Many other source code improvements... [Gondim]

1.1 

- Automatic configuration od /proc parameters.
- Spoof chacking against IANA reserved address spaces.
- Flooding protection. [Isamp]

1.0b

- BUG FIX: problem loading TROJANS variable when creating rules. [Gondim]
